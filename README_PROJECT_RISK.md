# üîç Project Risk Prediction & Actionable Agent

This project uses Machine Learning to predict employee attrition (churn risk) and recommends actions for HR/Project Managers using an AI-powered agent logic.

---

## üìä Problem Statement

Organizations often face delays or disruptions when employees are likely to leave. This project predicts **who is at risk of leaving** and provides **actionable recommendations** to retain them.

---

## üß† ML Models Used

Trained and evaluated the following algorithms:

- Decision Tree Regressor üå≥  
- Linear Regression üìà  
- Random Forest Regressor üå≤  
- Support Vector Machine (SVR) üí°  
- XGBoost Regressor ‚ö°  

Best model was selected based on R¬≤ score and used for final deployment.

## üìÅ Dataset

**Source:** IBM HR Analytics Dataset  
**Filename:** `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`  
**Target Column:** `Attrition` (Yes/No ‚Üí 1/0)  
**Key Features Used:**
- Age, Monthly Income, Distance From Home
- Job Satisfaction, Department, Job Role
- OverTime, Marital Status, etc.

## üîÑ Agent Logic (AI Decision Loop)

> Predict ‚Üí Interpret ‚Üí Recommend ‚Üí Notify

### ‚úîÔ∏è Example Flow:
1. **Predicts risk score** from employee profile  
2. **Interprets risk level** (low, medium, high)  
3. **Recommends actions** like:
   - Assign mentor
   - Reduce workload
   - Schedule 1-on-1
4. **(Optional)**: Can send Slack/Email notification to HR

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Run the App (Streamlit)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run app:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/project_risk_streamlit_app.py
```

---

## üì¶ Model Export

Final selected model is saved as:
```bash
models/project_risk_model.pkl
```
You can reuse it in the Streamlit app or any automation pipeline.

## ‚úÖ Predictions Example

| Test | Risk Score | Recommendation                          |
|------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1    | 0.78       | Assign a mentor and reduce workload      |
| 2    | 0.65       | Schedule 1-on-1                          |
| 3    | 0.33       | No immediate action needed               |
| 4    | 0.89       | High risk - escalate to management       |

---

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

- Integrate with Slack/Email notification  
- Add SHAP interpretability  
- Deploy on cloud (e.g., Heroku, Streamlit Cloud)  
- Extend to project delay prediction (team-level)
